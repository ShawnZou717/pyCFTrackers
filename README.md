# pyCFTrackers with an Onmidirectional Scale Estimator
Python re-implementation of some correlation filter based tracker

This project is adapted from the [pyTracker project released by fengyang95](https://github.com/fengyang95/pyCFTrackers).

The improvement of pyTracker is as follows:
1. An (OSE) Omnidirectional Scale Estimator is added to replace the original scale estimator in DCF-CSR tracker;

You can find the working mechanism of this OSE in the technique report in [GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1i-294Y137ySk-4afjPpypxodpGenpJPZ?usp=share_link)

The Omnidirectional Scale Estimator source codes locate at [MRScale_estimator.py](https://github.com/ShawnZou717/pyCFTrackers/blob/master/cftracker/MRScale_estimator.py). Details are explained below.

## Omnidirectional Scale Estimator
The geomatric optics theory has shown that radious along different directions varies at different rate in the imaging plane if the object is moving (See technique report in [GoogleDrive](https://github.com/ShawnZou717/pyCFTrackers/blob/master/cftracker/MRScale_estimator.py)).
